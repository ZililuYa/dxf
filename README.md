# dxf

DXF parser for node/browser.

Uses some ES6 features (classes, let, const, arrows). If you need to use this library in a browser without support for these features, you can use Webpack + Babel to package it.

V2.0 is a complete rewrite from the first attempt to write it in a SAX style, which wasn't really appropriate for a document with nested references (e.g inserts referencing blocks, nested inserts).

At this point in time, the important geometric entities are supported, but notably:

 * MTEXT
 * DIMENSION
 * STYLE

and some others are **parsed**, but are **not supported for SVG rendering** (see section below on SVG rendering)


## Getting started

There are some examples in the ```examples/``` directory that show how to use the library, but there are 3 basic steps:

1. Parse the DXF contents using ```dxf.parseString()```. This will return an object representation of the DXF contents.
1. Denormalise the entities into an array using ```dxf.denormalize()```. After Step 1, the entities are still in the block hierarchy of the DXF file, denormalizing will create the *resulting* entities with the block transforms applied.
1. (Optional) Create an SVG using ```dxf.toSVG()```. Please refer to the SVG section below regarding limitations.

## Running the Examples

To run the Group By Layer example:
`npm run ex:group`

To run the SVG output example (this will output `./examples/example.svg`):
`npm run ex:svg`

## SVG

The initial aim of this library was to support rendering of the main geometric components, not dimensions, text, hatches and styles. There is a mechanism for converting the parsed entities to SVG, but they are **all converted to polylines**, and if you look at the resulting SVG files when running the functional tests, you will see that all entities are rendered as paths.

Here's an example you will find in the functional test output:

## Tests

Running

```$ gulp test```

will execute the unit tests and functional tests, which generate SVGs for reference DXF files. You can view these SVGs (located in test/functional/output) in a browser or other SVG viewer to see what is supported.
